# Alerts for MongoDB in GKE

## Connections Near Max

If connections are approaching the limit, then new connections cannot be established. By default the mongod rejects connections at around 52000. Applications may stop functioning if connections cannot be established.

### Creating notification Channels and User Labels

Whether these alert policies are being used as standalones or base templates for a deployment strategy like terraform, one thing that should be utilized is notification channels and user labels.

### User Labels

Supplying user labels could give extra identification information about the firing alert:

i.e.

```json
    "userLabels": {
        "datacenter": "central"
    }
```

#### Notification Channels

The ID of the notification channel to be notified.

```json
    "notificationChannels": [
        "projects/project-id/notificationChannels/1234567
    ]
```
