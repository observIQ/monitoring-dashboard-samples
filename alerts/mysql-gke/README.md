# MySQL Alerts for GKE

## Connection errors alert
Connection errors mean a connection failed to be established. This indicates applications may be having trouble connecting to your MySQL database. See the `error` label on the time-series that triggers the alert for a more specific cause.


### Creating notification Channels and User Labels

Whether these alert policies are being used as standalones or base templates for a deployment strategy like terraform, one thing that should be utilized is notification channels and user labels.

### User Labels

Supplying user labels could give extra identification information about the firing alert:

i.e.

```json
    "userLabels": {
        "datacenter": "central"
    }
```

### Notification Channels

The ID of the notification channel to be notified.

```json
    "notificationChannels": [
        "projects/project-id/notificationChannels/1234567"
    ]
```
