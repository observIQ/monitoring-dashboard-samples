    description: "The request rate is derived from the requests metrics taken as a rate over a 5 minute interval. This value should be monitored beforehand to understand what qualifies as a normal request rate so a threshold can be established. When the request rate is above this threshold, then that means there is a large spike in traffic for a particular controller pod."

    description: "The connections dropped value is derived from the connections accepted minus the connections handled. This value should be near 0. When this value is rising, it means you may have a resource saturation problem."
